# Caesar Cipher Tool

This repository contains a simple Caesar Cipher tool, which encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar cipher method. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.


## Features
Encrypt text with a specified shift value.

Decrypt text by reversing the shift.

Handles uppercase and lowercase letters.


## Limitations
Only works with the English alphabet.

Shift values outside the range of -25 to 25 are normalized to this range.
